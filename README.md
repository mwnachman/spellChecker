# spellChecker

With more time, I would have made more tests.  I also would have broken elements of the SpellChecker out into Corrector and FileMaker classes that would have handled the correction logic and read/written files like the lowercase file and the final corrected file.  I would also like to see capital letters, punctuation and newlines accounted for.
